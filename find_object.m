%{

DESCRIPTION:
Find reference image (edge image) in target image (edge image)
using generalized hough transform (GHT)
by rotating and scaling of the reference.

INPUT:
target: target image as binary edge image (edges = 1, rest = 0)
reference: reference image as binary edge image (edges = 1, rest = 0)

OUTPUT
target_marked: target image with the best match of the reference
reference_marked: best match of the reference (with scaling and rotation)
YBest, XBest: coordinates of the reference point of the best match
ang: angular position of the best match
score: maximum score of the best match

% --- Initialization ------------------------------------------------------

% --- Rotate and scale reference and run GHT ------------------------------
% Rotate and scale the reference in two for loops.
% You can use "rotate_binary_edge_image.m" for rotation and the matlab
% function "imresize" for scaling.
% Which rotation angles are useful, which scaling factors are useful?
% Call GHT ("generalized_hough_transform." with the modified reference
% and compare the results to the previous results.
% You can use the score of the GHT for comparing the results.
% Save the results and settings (rotation angle and scaling factor) of the
% best match.
% You can use the following variables: YBest, XBest, ang, scale, score

for ang = 0:10:360 % rotate image

    for scale = 0.5:0.1:2 % scale image

        refY = ref(1);
        refX = ref(2);
        [current_score,y,x,~] = generalized_hough_transform(target, scaled_reference, refY, refX); % call GHT with the modified reference

              % save results and settings
